## Deployment

### Prerequisites

This prototype supports deployment to AWS App Runner. You'll need the following
to deploy the app:

- An AWS account
- AWS CLI v1
  - In addition to installing the AWS CLI, you must also authenticate it so it
    can access your AWS account. See Amazon's
    [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-authentication-user.html)
    on how to authenticate the AWS CLI using an IAM user
- Docker
- Bash
- Node.js
- `jq`

### Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

```sh
git clone git@github.com:calebj0seph/fabra-prototype.git
```

2. **Install dependencies with `yarn`**

```sh
cd fabra-prototype
yarn
```

3. **Build & deploy the app** \
   This will automatically create all necessary AWS resources for you. By
   default, the `ap-southeast-2` region is used.

```sh
yarn deploy
```

4. **Create a user account in the app**

```sh
curl https://<service URL>/api/register_account \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

    "displayName": "Test User",
